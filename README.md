# Prediction of app subscription users with ML algorithm
Personal project developed during the STRV Data Science Academy 2022

Our client has a financial company, and they've launched an app for their customers to have access to their loans, savings, and other relevant financial data. This app has both a free and a Premium version. Some of the features are unlocked when a user pays for a subscription.

We have a dataset containing some user information and user app behavior, and our job is to predict if an app customer will enroll to Premium or not based on their activity. By having a model that can predict that, the company will be able to create targeted marketing campaigns and customized offers, therefore saving money.
